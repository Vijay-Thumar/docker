** Docker basic commands
docker Run Image_Name                                    (This command will run the image or container if does not exist then it will download image and run it.)
docker stop container_id/container_name                  (stop the docker images aka container)
docker ps                                                (It will list running images "-a" flag will list all the container available)
docker ps -a                                             (to list all the container even if they are stop)
docker rm Cid/Cname another_cid another_cid2             (remove the container)
docker pull image_name                                   (download image from internet)
docker run ubuntu sleep 5                                (os will be sleep into the 5 seconds) -- if the image is not running any task then it will be exited from container list
docker exec container_id command                         (execute command into the container) ex: docker exec 538d cat /etc/host (print all items inside folder)  **** This will also run the command on running container ****
docker run -d ubuntu sleep 100                           (this will detach the terminal from the process and execute everything into the back ground)
docker attach container_id                               (to reattach the terminal to the container)

** docker images commands
docker rmi image_name/image_id                           (remove the images that we have pull from docker hub)
docker images                                            (list of images)

** version install
docker run ubuntu:20.0.0                                 (tag ":" this will be used for defining a specific version of images that you want from docker hub this all tags will be available in images description)
docker -i image_name                                     (this will the used for interactive mode)
docker -it image_name                                    (-it where t stands for sudo terminal so we have interaction with terminal mode)

** port mapping command
docker run -p 3306:3306 mysql                            (this will take 3306:3306 first will be the container inside port and bind with machine port 3306 actual port so we can access that using our port)
