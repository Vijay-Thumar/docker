** Docker basic commands
docker Run Image_Name                                    (This command will run the image or container if does not exist then it will download image and run it.)
docker ps                                                (It will list running images "-a" flag will list all the container available)
docker stop container_id/container_name                  (stop the docker images aka container)
docker rm Cid/Cname                                      (remove the container)
docker images                                            (list of images)
docker pull image_name                                   (download image from internet)
docker run ubuntu sleep 5                                (os will be sleep into the 5 seconds) -- if the image is not running any task then it will be exited from container list
docker exec container_id command                         (execute command into the container) ex: docker exec 538d cat /etc/host (print all items inside folder)
